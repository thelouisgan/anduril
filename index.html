                            <li>F1 in Schools&#8482; is the only global multi-disciplinary challenge in which teams of students aged 9 to 19 deploy CAD/CAM software to collaborate, design, analyse, manufacture, test, and then race miniature compressed air powered balsa wood F1 cars.</li>
                            <li>Teams must raise sponsorship and manage budgets to fund research, travel and accommodation.</li>
                            <li>The challenge inspires students to use IT to learn about physics, aerodynamics, design, manufacture, branding, graphics, sponsorship, marketing, leadership/teamwork, media skills and financial strategy, and apply them in a practical, imaginative, competitive and exciting way.</li>
                            <li>The founding constitution of F1 in Schools stipulates that it is, and shall remain, a not-for-profit organisation.  Funds raised through sponsorship are invested in administering, developing and expanding the challenge. All income is deployed in accordance with guidelines laid down by Formula 1.</li>
