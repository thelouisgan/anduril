                    As a team from Marlborough College Malaysia in the F1 in Schools campaign, Anduril will be a competitor in 
                    various competitions around Malaysia such as the Johor State Finals in late June and with the FOBISIA Malaysian 
                    Schools in Q4 this year. We will be exposed to thousands of national and international judges and fellow 
                    competitors around the country, as well as the sole provider for the track and racing competition for Marlborough 
                    College Malaysia for future races.
